# 🕵️‍♂️ Black Hat Python — Personal Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal journey through the book **Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters (2nd Edition)** by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold. This repository contains my hands-on implementations, experiments, and notes while progressing through each chapter of the book. It is intended for **educational and ethical** hacking purposes only.

> "The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear." – Ram Dass

## 🧭 Repository Structure

```
black-hat-python/
├── chapter-01/         # Basic Python setup and test tools
├── chapter-02/         # TCP/UDP clients and servers
├── chapter-03/         # Sniffers and Man-in-the-Middle tools
├── chapter-04/         # SSH automation with Paramiko
├── ...
└── README.md           # You are here
```

Each folder includes:
- 📜 Python scripts based on the book
- ✍️ Comments and annotations for clarity
- ⚠️ Custom modifications or observations (where applicable)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Before running the scripts, ensure your system meets the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Unix/Linux system or WSL (for Windows users)
- Common libraries: `socket`, `os`, `subprocess`, `paramiko`, `struct`, etc.

Install any needed dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Reference

This work is based on the book:

- **Black Hat Python, 2nd Edition**  
  _By Justin Seitz & Tim Arnold_  
  📖 https://www.nostarch.com/blackhatpython2

All implementations are my personal interpretations and experiments based on the material presented.

## ✍️ Author & Intent

**Author:** `YG`  
**Focus:** Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Python Learner | Ethical Hacker-in-Progress  

This repository serves as a learning log — a record of scripting experiments, insights, and progress. It reflects not just technical implementation, but curiosity and ethical awareness.

## 🧠 Side Note: Root-Level Learning

> _“To understand the machine, one must become still—  
>  not to command it, but to listen as it speaks in pulses, in silence, in code.”_  
>  — Unknown Cipherist

This repository is not merely a collection of scripts, but a chronicle of a student's discipline in the craft of cybersecurity. Each line of Python reflects an exploration — not of chaos, but of structure. Not of destruction, but of understanding.

In the tradition of those who came before — the tinkerers, the quiet minds, the ones who pulled back the curtain — this work seeks to learn, not to exploit. To uncover, not to intrude.

If you tread this path, do so with **integrity** and **curiosity**, for the systems you study are built by people, not just protocols.

> _“You climb the tree not to tear it down, but to know its structure. And when you know it, you can protect or penetrate — wisely, and with purpose.”_
